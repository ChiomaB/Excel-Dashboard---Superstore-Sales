**Data Analysis Methodology**
Data Representation: Data was transformed into visual formats using Pivot Tables, enhancing clarity and accessibility for stakeholders. This approach allowed for quick identification of trends and performance metrics.

**Statistical Analysis**: Key functions such as “IF” and “RANKAVG” were utilized to perform detailed analyses, facilitating a deeper understanding of sales performance.

**Performance Insights**:
The analysis revealed significant revenue contributions from different segments, with the Consumer segment leading in revenue generation. This underscores the importance of focusing marketing efforts in this area.
State-level performance showed that California was the top performer, followed by New York, indicating strong market presence in these regions.
